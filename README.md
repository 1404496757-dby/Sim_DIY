Shoot me any bugs, enhancements or even discussion by [creating issues](https://github.com/jxx123/simglucose/issues/new).

## How to contribute

The following instruction is originally from the [contribution instructions of sklearn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The preferred workflow for contributing to simglucose is to fork the
[main repository](https://github.com/jxx123/simglucose) on
GitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:

1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/jxx123/simglucose)
   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates
   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on
   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

2. Clone your fork of the simglucose repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/simglucose.git
   $ cd simglucose
   ```

3. Create a `feature` branch to hold your development changes:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

   Always use a `feature` branch. It's good practice to **never work on the `master` branch**!

4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using `git add` and then `git commit` files:

   ```bash
   $ git add modified_files
   $ git commit
   ```

   to record your changes in Git, then push the changes to your GitHub account with:

   ```bash
   $ git push -u origin my-feature
   ```

5. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
   to create a pull request from your fork. This will email the committers.

(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the
[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)
